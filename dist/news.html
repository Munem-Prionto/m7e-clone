                    <h1>How Does Experiential Learning Work?</h1>
                    <h4>March 26, 2020</h4>
                </div>
                <p>Experiential learning is a great way for both students and teachers to gain knowledge from an active learning opportunity.  David A. Kolb is credited with coming up with the 4 stages of experiential learning, something we here at M7E truly believe in.  The 4 stages are:</p>
                <p>1.Concrete Experience: - This is the experience itself.  It involves a hands-on learning experience that can take place anywhere, indoors or outdoors.  The learner will come across an experience that they have not had before and actively absorb this new material.  Here at M7E we focus on this part of the experiential learning cycle, providing students with the initial, first hand experience that will both pique their interest in a subject as well as help them absorb new material.</p>
                <p>2.Reflective Observation: - After the completion of the activity the learners take time to reflect back on the experience.  This is different to critical thinking, but learners observe what is going on around them as a result of the experience.  With our trips we hope that the students do this either during the trip or immediately after, but it up to the teacher and the tour leaders to facilitate this.</p>
                <p>3.Abstract Conceptualisation: - The learner is beginning to think about the experience and how it could be repeated or modified to different situations.  It is during this stage that the learner develops a personal theory about their experience.  This stage is key for teachers understanding what the learners took away from the experience</p>
                <p>4.Active Experimentation: - This is where the learner goes back to an activity and uses their new found experience and theories to make decisions in order to determine how the best outcome can be achieved.  We are extremely interested in this and ask teachers to supply us with anonymised data to show whether or not the trips we are sending the students on are having a positive effect on their learning. </p>
